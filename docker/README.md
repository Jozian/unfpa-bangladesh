# Primero Docker

## Overview

Docker for Primero consists of the following containers: application,
beanstalkd, Nginx, Postgres, and solr. It is compatible with MacOS and modern
Linux distributions.

An overview of the steps required to setup Primero is as follows:
1. Install Docker and Python3
2. Create a virtualenv in the root primero folder `venv`
3. Install the docker and docker-compose pip packages
4. Build with `./build dev`
5. Start container with `./compose.dev.sh up` and then stop it with Control-C
6. Modify configuration files in config dir
7.a. To run primero/puma in the background run `./compose.dev.sh up -d`
7.b. To run the container and enter bash, not automatically starting primero,
run `./helper run`
7.c. To enter a running container, use `./helper enter`

Note: you can pass arguments with enter or run on the help script like:
`./helper.sh run echo test`
This will override the default bash shell and run 'echo test' instead.


## Installing Docker and Docker-Compose on Linux

First, install Docker on Linux through the [official docker
website.](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

We will also want the python bindings for Docker and Docker-Compose, which is
written in Python. On Linux, I recommend you use virtualenv to install a recent
copy of Python and the docker/docker-compose pip packages. We recommend
virtualenv as it elimanates the possibly that the package manager will override
or change your build environment.

On MacOS, you can use your default python installation, provided you install the
docker and docker-compose pip packages. We still recommend virtualenv.

Most Linux distributions come with a version of python installed. To install
virtualenv, do it from pip: `python3 -m pip install virtualenv`. Virtualenv can
also frequently be found in your package manager.

Next, install python, docker, and docker compose in a virtual environment as
follows:

```bash
cd ~/Primero
virtualenv venv # create a virtualenv in a folder called venv
source venv/bin/activate # load your venv
pip install docker docker-compose # install required packages
```

## How to Configure the Containers

There are currently two configurations: production and local. The difference is
that production mode, by default, will try and generate LetsEncrypt signed
certificates. This must be configured in the env file. Each deployment
configuration has an env file. Additionally, there is a 'defaults' file which
always inherits from.

The docker containers are configured through environment variables. Environment
variables are defined in the .env files and are propagated into config files at
run time. Each configuration has a respective env file: production.env and
local.env.

Start by looking at the defaults.env file to get a look at which env options can
be modified.

### Configuration - Production

To configure for production, simply look at the defaults.env file and override
any settings you wish to change. Otherwise, you can simply run the production
container with the default settings.

### Configuration - Development

Currently, the dev container settings are not templatized. To create configs for
development, you will need two environments setup in your config files. These
are 'development' and 'testing' respectively.


Primero ships with a default set of configurations for development. If you are
missing any of the configuration files in the config directory, the dev
container will automatically copy the appropriate file into place. Once the
files are copied into place, they will show up in the config directory as
example.yml file. You can change these files as the container will not overwrite
them.

Alternatively, you can create the config files manually as shown below:

Create a set of config files by using the following command:
`./generate_dev_config.sh`

This will produce a set of config files with the development environment
configured. To create the testing environment, within each yml file, duplicate
the dev config as the testing environment and make the appropriate changes for
testing.

Look at the config/examples folder to see an example of working dev config
files.

## Folder Structure

All of the Docker components of Primero live in the docker sub folder. Inside
the docker folder are sub folders for each container: application, development,
nginx, etc, and an app_common folder that contains shared resources between the
production and the development container.

## Building - Docker Build Context

To reduce build time, most of the containers have their build context set to the
docker directory. The reason for this is that for each container, the entire
build context (ie folder) must be sent to the docker instance. The downside is
that you cannot include files in a container outside of the build context. Thus,
the application and solr containers, which rely on configurations outside of the
docker dir, are set to include the entire project in their build context.

## Building - Instructions

To build simply run: `./build.sh all`
This will build each container with the tag 'prim-latest'. These will be
referenced in the docker-compose files.

Note, docker-compose files should not be used as 'docker makefiles.' This will
cause issues down the line. Thus, it is important that building be provided
through other means than the docker-compose file.

## Deploying Locally with Docker Compose

To deploy locally, simply run: `./compose.local.sh up`. The default
configurations provided should work. Local is set to generate and use self
signed SSL certificates.

## Deploying - Remote Building - Not Recommended

Note, that the approach proposed here is not ideal. We will be performing the
building on the remote server through a remotely mounted docker socket. This
wastes performance and resources on a production server. This deployment method
was chosen due to limitations in time and should be replaced.

To deploy remotely, we are going to mount the docker socket of a remote server
and then use our local docker tools. To mount the socket into your home
directory, use the following SSH call.

```bash
ssh -nNT -L $HOME/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock user@remoteserver.com
```

Note, this call must be left running in a terminal. You can append the `-f` flag
to the ssh call to background the call.

This will map your remote docker socket onto the local file system. In order to
use the socket, you have to tell Docker through an environment variable.
Export your DOCKER_HOST variable: `DOCKER_HOST="unix:///$HOME/docker.sock"`.

Run `docker ps` and you should see you are using your remote server. You will
need to rebuild your containers if they have only been built locally. To rebuild
them, run `./build.sh all`

Check the defaults.env and production.env and make sure you have set you DOMAIN
and LetsEncrypt parameters set appropriately. After that, run with
docker-compose. `./compose.prod.sh up -d`

## Configuration Options - Environment Variables

Docker for Primero is configured through environment variables. At runtime, the
containers will generate appropriate configuration files based on what values
you have the environment variables set to.

config option - parameter - description

APP_ROOT - file path - this is where Primero gets copied to in the app
container. Changing this parameter has not been tested.

BEANSTALK_URL - address which Primero should try to access beanstalk
this should be set to the container name and port

RAILS_ENV - production / development - sets the build / run mode for Primero.
RAILS_LOG_PATH - path - where Primero will store its logs

NGINX_SERVER_HOST - name to put in the self signed certificate. if letsencrypt
is used, then we will store the host name received from CertBot here.
NGINX_SERVER_NAME - sets the server name in the nginx site config file. ie what
name nginx responds too.
NGINX_SSL_CLIENT_CA, NGINX_SSL_KEY_PATH - path - location where nginx will look
for and store its self signed certificates
nginx_cert
NGINX_HTTP_PORT, NGINX_HTTPS_PORT - port for http/s
NGINX_PROXY_PASS_URL - address which nginx will proxy towards. this should point
towards the app/puma container.
NGINX_LOG_ERROR, NGINX_LOG_ACCESS - name of respective log files.
NGINX_LOG_DIR - path of the folder for the nginx logs
NGINX_KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT - time out length for nginx
NGINX_DH_PARAM - path of the diffie hellman group. this will be generated
automatically at container start.

USE_LETS_ENCRYPT - set this to `true` to use certbot to generate ssl certs. it
is set to `false` for local by default. if this is set, then you must set the
following as well.
LETS_ENCRYPT_DOMAIN - domain to put on ssl cert. only supports one domain.
LETS_ENCRYPT_EMAIL - email for cert. must be set.

POSTGRES_DATABASE - name - sets the database name for Primero to use
POSTGRES_HOSTNAME - name of the app container. this is the address which other
containers will use to access postgres.

SOLR_HOSTNAME - hostname for solr. solr needs to self reference from this
hostname and other containers will access solr using this hostname
SOLR_PORT - port for solr. default is 8983.
SOLR_LOGS_DIR - dir for solr logging
SOLR_LOG_LEVEL - sets the logging level for solr. `INFO` or `ERROR`

LOCALE_DEFAULT - set this to the language which Primero will use. `en` by
default.

## Troubleshooting

Primero's Docker containers rely heavily on Docker containers. If you are having
issues, it may make sense to delete all of your volumes and rebuild. Do not do
this on a production instance! You will lose all of your data.

```bash
./compose.prod.sh down
docker volume prune
./build.sh all
./compose.prod.sh up
```

## Containers - NGINX and CertBot

Currently, CertBot is being performed from inside of the NGINX container. We are
using supervisor to accomplish this.

## Environmental Substitution

On Primero's Docker, we substitute values in from our Docker environment
into the container config files at runtime. To do this, we place shell style
variables in any config file and then point the sub.sh script towards the
correct folder. This is explained in detail in the sub.sh errata section.

## Technical Errata - sub.sh

Dependencies: envsubst and bash

The sub.sh script performs substitutions on configuration files during runtime
container creation. Pass sub.sh a folder path and it will search for template
files recursively.

The sub.sh script looks through the specified folder, and all sub-directories,
for any files ending in `.template`. Within those files, it looks for any shell
style variables: `$HOST` or `${HOST}` and performs substitution from the
environment (ie .env files). It will create a copy of the file without the
`.template` suffix.

Note: the script will not perform substitutions on variables that are not
defined. For example, NGINX config files use the shell variable style for
internal variables. These will be left alone.

The substitution are performed during the container entrypoint script. To use
add the follow section to your entrypoint after copying the sub.sh script to the
container root.

```bash
/sub.sh folder_path
```

The list of folders to operate on are stored as a bash array. Edit the list of
folders to operate on. This can also be overridden in the environment.

## Container Requirements

The all entrypoints are written in Bash. Thus, Bash must be installed on the
containers.
